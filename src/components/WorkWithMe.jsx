      <h1>Work With Me</h1>

      <p>
        I work primarily with{" "}
        <strong>goal-driven cryptocurrency projects</strong> to engage and grow
        their communities.
      </p>

      <p>
        All procedures begin with a strategy, and depending on your needs, I can
        either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>ðŸ“Œ Just draw up a strategy for you</li>
        <li>ðŸ“Œ Draw up a strategy & manage the community</li>
        <li>ðŸ“Œ Just manage the community using your strategy</li>
        <li>
          ðŸ“Œ Provide team members (Discord developer, moderators, social media
          managers) to handle your project
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I have been in the{" "}
        <strong>Community Management space for 5 years</strong>, working across
        industries like digital marketing, branding, business, finance, and
        food.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over the past year, I have specialized in the{" "}
        <strong>crypto space</strong>, transitioning from a Community Moderator
        to a full-fledged Community Manager.
      </p>

      <p className="highlight">
        Essentially, Iâ€™m the one who wakes up in the morning with your community
        in mind. ðŸš€

        <h2>Community Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          This package is ideal for projects that already have a community team
          but need structured strategies to enhance engagement.
        </p>
        <p>

          a full team.
        </p>

        <h3>How it works:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>âœ… I review your project details and goals.</li>
          <li>âœ… You share your expectations for the community.</li>
          <li>âœ… I develop a tailored community strategy.</li>
          <li>âœ… First draft is sent for review.</li>
          <li>âœ… Final strategy is delivered after two revisions.</li>
        </ul>
