          <h2>My Community Management Journey</h2>

          <p>
            I started my crypto journey as a <strong>full-time trader</strong>{" "}
            before transitioning into <strong>community management</strong>.
            Before that, I spent about a year as a{" "}
            <strong>bounty hunter</strong>, writing articles for various crypto
            communities.
          </p>

          <p>
            That experience introduced me to the{" "}
            <strong>power of community engagement</strong>, and since then, Iâ€™ve
            been deeply invested in
            <strong>building and managing thriving communities</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the years, Iâ€™ve worked across different sectorsâ€”including{" "}
            <strong>business, finance, branding, fitness, and music</strong>â€”but
            my passion remains in <strong>crypto communities</strong>. I
            specialize in:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              âœ… Developing effective{" "}
              <strong>community growth strategies</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              âœ… Building and leading <strong>strong, engaged teams</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
              âœ… Ensuring projects have the right{" "}
              <strong>community support to succeed</strong>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As a personal brand, I strive to be the{" "}
            <strong>mentor I never had</strong> when I first entered the space.
            I actively share <strong>knowledge and resources</strong> to equip
            emerging community leaders across the crypto ecosystem.
